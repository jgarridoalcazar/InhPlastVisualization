// ----- help messages ---------------------------------------------

#define STARTUP_HE "\n\
Welcome to uego configuration!\n\n\
Please type in the requested values. If the default value in () is ok\n\
just type <enter>. If you are editing an existing configuration, then\n\
the defalult values are read from that configuration.\n\
If not sure, type h<enter>; a help message will be shown reagarding the\n\
actual item if available. If you want to cancel configuration, type q<enter>.\n\n"

#define SEED_HE "\n\
The random seed determines the random numbers created during optimalization.\n\
With the same random seed, the same results will come out on every platform.\n\
Choose a number from [ 1 , 2^32-1 ], large numbers are better.\n\n"

//#define TYPE_HE : see above at search spaces

#define FNUM_HE "\n\
It is possible to encode several functions so that you could run experiments\n\
on them without recompiling the system over and over again. The number you\n\
give here can be seen from the evaluator function, and can be used in e.g.\n\
a 'switch' command. If you did not use this feature, this value is not\n\
effective; otherwise give the number of function you would like to experiment\n\
with.\n\n"

#define REC_HE "\n\
Give the number of new facilities you want to localize\n\n"


#define DIM_HE "\n\
Give the dimensionality of the search space you are using. In the real case,\n\
it is the number of real parameters of the function, in the binary case, the\n\
number of bits, etc.\n\
It must be at least 1.\n\n"

#define PARS_HE "\n\
It is possible to pass constant parameters to a function. Here, you can\n\
give the name of a text file to load these parameters from. Hitting <enter>\n\
will cancel choosing a file.\n\
The file format is simple: it should contain the number of parameters and\n\
then the real parameters separated by whitespace. Lines beginning with a '#'\n\
are ignored. Lines should be no longer than 10000 characters. Be sure to\n\
close the last line with a <newline> character.\n\n"

#define PARNUM_HE "\n\
It is possible to pass constant parameters to a function. Here, you can give\n\
the number of these parameters. If your function does not use any, give 0.\n\n"

// --- uego special
#define MAXEV_HE "\n\
Give the number of evaluations you want to devote to this experiment.\n\
The actual evaluation number will not exceed the given limit but may\n\
be less.\n\n"

#define MAXSPEC_HE "\n\
The maximum number of species allowed to exist in the same time.\n\
This value can be understood as a kind of exploration parameter: greater\n\
values mean more extensive exploration. If your function does not have\n\
too many 'peaks' give small values, otherwise give a larger value.\n\
It is safe to give smaller values than the actual number of local optima\n\
but if a large value is given for a function with few local optima then most\n\
of the evaluations will be devoted to finding the non-existing peaks.\n\
Do not forget, that the number of function evaluations is shared among the\n\
existing species, so this value should be much smaller than the number of\n\
function evaluations, of course.\n\n"

#define THR_HE "\n\
This is a threshold that represents a trade-off between resolution (or\n\
exploration) and stability. Setting 1 means that every species at every\n\
level is guaranteed to receive enough function evaluations to move from its\n\
creation place as far as the diameter of the space. 0.5 means the half of\n\
this distance and so on.\n\
Setting 1 seems to be a good choice in general.\n\n"

#define LEVELS_HE "\n\
Quite hard to explain... Well if your function has a kind of fractal-like\n\
structure, it may be reasonable to set a higher value; the role of this\n\
parameter is still under investegation (experiments show that the performance\n\
may depend on this value, sometimes higher values are slighly better, but\n\
sometimes not). Setting e.g. 3 seems to be safe in general.\n\n"

#define LAST_R_HE "\n\
The resolution of search. The radius of species on the final level.\n\
The optima found are at least this far from each other. The smaller the\n\
given value is the more evaluaions are needed.\n\
This parameter is NOT directly related to the expected error of the\n\
solutions; set very small values only if you want to find different local\n\
optima that are close to each other, or if you are looking for needle-like\n\
peaks.\n\n"

#define MISS_HE "\n\
Every 1 of the last 5 parameters is determined by the remaining 4. Here\n\
you can specify the one that you want to be counted using the other 4\n\
values. It is reasonable to choose the most obscure one if you do not have\n\
a better idea. Currently, the valid choises are:\n\n\
   0: function evaluations\n\
   1: max. species number\n\
   2: stability threshold\n\
   4: smallest radius\n\n\
If you got an error message after this (something like 'No solution exists')\n\
then try one (or more) of these next time: increase function evaluations,\n\
decrease threshold, increase smallest radius, decrease max species number.\n\n"
